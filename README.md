# 10-HW-Template-Engine-Employee-Summary
Unit 10 OOP Homework Assignment. UW Coding Bootcamp.

## Description
This project is to build a software engineering team generator command line application. Through user input this command line application will then generate an html file to the a specific output folder. The generated html file with link to a live webpage that will allow the user to manage their team of engineers and interns. This application must also pass all unit tests.

## Development Story
This project presented new coding challenges. I think the most difficult concept to learn was unit testing and test-driven coding. This was also one of the first applications that dealt with groups of files that were all dependent on each other. 

Creating a command line application is one task but making it easy to use is another. For those without knowledge of coding, the prompts in the command may seem like a strange way to interact with a computer. However, some simple styling (through the use of console.log()) can be really healpful.

Taking into account all the separate files, I think the most challenging part of this project was connecting all the pages to work together achieve the desired result. Tutorials provided by instructors also went a long way to improving comprehension.

## User Story
    As a manager
    I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
    so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles


## Acceptance Criteria
    GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
    WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
    THEN an html page is generated containing all the employee information that has been added
    GIVEN a prompt to add a new employee 
    WHEN the user selects from the listed options (Engineer, Intern, None)
    THEN the user is prompted for further information pertaining to that employee
    THEN the user is again prompted to add a new employee (Engineer, Intern, None)
    IF the user selected either engineer or intern, the process repeats
    IF the user selects "none" the application terminates and generates an HTML file

    The generated HTML file contains all the information that the user provided and allows the user to have quick access to employee information.
